    <h1><b>Lorem Ipsum</b></h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
        <b>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</b>  when an unknown printer took a galley of <br>
        type and scrambled it to <i>make a type specimen book. <b><u>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</b></u></i> <br>
        It was popularised <b>in the 1960s with the release</b>  of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum <i><u>passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like</u></i>  Aldus PageMaker <br>
        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
